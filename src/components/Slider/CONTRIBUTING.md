## Opening an Issue

Thanks for contributing! If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please make sure it hasn't already been reported. You can search through existing issues and PRs to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.

Next, create a new issue that briefly explains the problem, and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it, and steps to reproduce it.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first.

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

When adding new features or modifying existing, please attempt to include tests to confirm the new behaviour.
